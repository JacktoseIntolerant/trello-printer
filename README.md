# trello-printer
This is a little script to print out the juicy parts of Trello cards.  
[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a very nice to-do/project management app, but it is painfully hard to get checklists out in a sensible format. This takes the JSON that Trello exports and gives you an HTML page with the card title, description, and checklists.

input: `card.json` in the same folder  
output: `card.html` in the same folder
